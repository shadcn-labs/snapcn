/**
 * Re-time a finished render to a 60fps container, by duplicating frames.
 *
 * Not cosmetic, and not about the demo: **Chrome paces a whole page's rendering
 * to the frame rate of the video playing on it.** Measured on an otherwise idle
 * page — one video, or none, and rAF runs at the display rate; two or more 30fps
 * videos and the entire page drops to 30fps. The showcase wall plays five or six
 * at once, so 30fps files pin the wall's own motion to 30fps, and a wall sliding
 * at constant velocity is the least forgiving thing there is to run at half rate.
 * Same clips at 60fps: the page holds 60.
 *
 * Frame duplication rather than a 60fps render, because the scenes are authored
 * on frame numbers against their config's fps — rendering them at 60 would play
 * them at half speed. This keeps every rendered frame exactly as authored and
 * only changes the cadence the container declares. Duplicate frames cost almost
 * nothing in H.264 (most of these files come out *smaller*), and it measures at
 * SSIM 0.998–0.9997 against the source.
 *
 * ## …and down to 960 wide, in the same pass
 *
 * Nothing ever paints one of these at 1280. There are three consumers and they
 * are all cards: the showcase wall (`stageWidth * 0.2` — 288 CSS px on a 1440
 * stage) and the two masonry grids in the docs (`sm:columns-2` → `xl:columns-4`,
 * so ~300 CSS px). The widest any of them gets on a 2× display is ~600 device
 * pixels, and 960 clears that with room left over.
 *
 * The 320 pixels above it were costing 4.2MB across the eleven demos and 44% of
 * the decode — which the wall pays at 60fps, five clips at a time, while its
 * canvas resamples every one of them into strips. Scaling here rather than at
 * render time keeps Remotion's output at the composition's real size; this pass
 * was already re-encoding, so it is free.
 *
 * If a demo ever gets shown full-bleed, this is the line that has to move.
 *
 * ## The full-size render is kept, not thrown away
 *
 * That reasoning is about the *site*, and it holds. It does not hold for X,
 * where the same clip plays full-bleed in the feed on a 3x phone — 960 wide is
 * below the 1280 X itself asks for, and it reads as a cheap export. The file
 * that satisfies both already exists for one moment: what Remotion just wrote,
 * at the composition's real size and CRF 18, before this pass shrinks it. So it
 * is copied to `social-exports/` first rather than being overwritten. No extra
 * render, no change to a single byte the site serves.
