/**
 * Take the paid items back out of `public/`.
 *
 * `shadcn build` has one output directory and writes every item into it, which
 * for a registry with a paid half means the paid half ships to the CDN as
 * static files. This runs straight after the build and moves those files into
 * `registry/.private/`, where the `/r/[file]` route reads them behind a key.
 *
 * The index (`public/r/registry.json`) keeps its pro entries and gains
 * `meta.access = "pro"`. That is deliberate: the built index carries no
 * `files[].content`, so listing a pro component there leaks nothing and is the
 * only way anyone — the gallery, the MCP, an agent — can find out the component
 * exists in order to want it. A paywall nobody can see is a deleted feature.
 *
 * No pro registry yet? Then this is a no-op and the free build is untouched.

 * it needs a key" instead of "no such component". A paywall nobody can see is
