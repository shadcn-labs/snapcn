 * Auth.js error codes, in the reader's language.
 *
 * The defaults are written for whoever configured the app, not for whoever is
 * trying to get in — "There is a problem with the server configuration" tells a
 * visitor nothing they can act on. Each of these ends with the next move.
 *
 * Keyed by the codes Auth.js **v5** sends (`isClientError` in @auth/core). This
 * table used v4's `OAuthSignin`/`OAuthCallback`, which v5 never sends, so a
 * cancelled consent screen (`OAuthCallbackError`) or a stale page
 * (`MissingCSRF`) fell through to the generic line.
 *
 * `Configuration` is every error v5 will not name to a client, and on a working
 * deployment the usual one is a callback that arrived without the PKCE cookie
 * its start set: the page reloaded mid-flow, or an app's in-app browser handed
 * the provider off to a different browser. So it tells the reader how to finish,
 * not that the site is broken; the real reason is `[auth][error]` in the logs.
