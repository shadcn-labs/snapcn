/**
 * POST /api/checkout — hand back a Dodo checkout URL for one product.
 *
 * Payload: `{ product: "everything_annual" | "lifetime" | … }` — any
 * `CHECKOUT_PRODUCTS` key. Response: `{ checkoutUrl }`.
 *
 * Nothing here grants anything. What comes back is a link to a page on Dodo's
 * domain, and a subscription created through it is `pending` until the money
 * actually moves — so the only thing that ever moves a user onto a paid plan is
 * `/api/webhooks/dodo`. Trusting this response instead would sell Pro to
 * anyone who can POST and then abandon the card form.
 *
 * Sign-in is **not** required. It was, so `metadata.user_id` would link every
 * payment to a person — and half of everyone who opened sign-in never finished
 * it, which put the wall in front of the card at exactly the wrong moment. A
 * signed-in buyer still gets `user_id`; a guest's payment carries the email
 * they typed on Dodo's page, and the webhook puts the plan on that address's
 * account, creating it if needed (`userIdForEmail`). Signing in with the same
 * address finds it.
