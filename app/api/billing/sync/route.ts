/**
 * Where Dodo sends someone after they pay — and the reconcile path for every
 * webhook that never arrives.
 *
 * The webhook is the fast path, not the reliable one. It is missed for ordinary
 * reasons: the endpoint was mid-deploy, the retries ran out, the tunnel was not
 * running in development, nobody registered the endpoint. Each of those ends
 * with a person who paid staring at the upgrade button they just used. Asking
 * Dodo directly closes that gap, and it is the same call whether the miss
 * lasted four seconds or four days.
 *
 * A GET that writes, deliberately. This is a browser redirect target — Dodo can
 * only send the buyer here with a navigation — and the write is an idempotent
 * upsert of state we did not author, so a refresh or a prefetch costs one API
 * call and changes nothing. The alternative is a landing page whose only content
 * is a POST it fires at itself.
