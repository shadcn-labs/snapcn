 * there is `pending` until the money moves. Everything a user is entitled to is
 * decided by an event that arrives here, which makes this file the trust
 * boundary for the whole paid tier: a request that gets past the signature
 * check can give itself Starter for free.
 *
 * Two rules follow from that, and both are easy to break by accident:
 *
 *  1. Verify the *raw* bytes, before parsing (see below).
 *  2. Never skip verification because the secret is missing.
 *
 * Everything else is about retries. Dodo re-sends any event that does not get a
 * 2xx, with backoff, for days — so the status code here is not decoration, it
 * is the decision "should this be tried again?". Answer it wrong in the
 * generous direction and one unprocessable event is redelivered forever;
 * answer it wrong in the other direction and a paid subscription silently
 * never activates.
