/**
 * Sign in / account control for the site header.
 *
 * Session comes from `useSession`, not from `auth()` in a server component, on
 * purpose: the landing page is statically rendered with a one-hour revalidate,
 * and reading the session upstream of it would turn every view of the busiest
 * page on the site into a function invocation. The cost of doing it here is one
 * `/api/auth/session` request after hydration, and a placeholder while it
 * resolves.
 *
 * The provider list is fetched with `getProviders()` when the dialog opens
 * rather than passed down, so nothing has to thread server-only env state
 * through the header — and an unconfigured deployment simply shows the
 * "not configured yet" copy `SignInButtons` already owns.

  // that anything is wrong. Rendering the button by default costs a signed-in
  // reader one frame of the wrong label; hiding it costs everyone else the
  // feature. It also puts "Sign in" in the server-rendered HTML, which is what
