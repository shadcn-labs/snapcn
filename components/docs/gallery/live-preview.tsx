/**
 * The live `<Player>` fallback, in its own chunk.
 *
 * Everything Remotion the gallery can possibly need is in this file and nothing
 * imports it statically — `gallery-card` and the detail overlay reach it through
 * `next/dynamic`, so the 599KB of component source and player runtime it drags
 * in is fetched only if a card turns up with no rendered demo.
 *
 * Today that is none of them: all 41 free components are in `RENDERED_DEMOS`
 * and the 35 paid ones are video by construction. The branch stays because the
 * alternative is a blank card the first time somebody adds a component and
 * forgets to render its demo — a silent hole, rather than a slow card.
