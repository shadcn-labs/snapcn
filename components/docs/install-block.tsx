/**
 * The install command for a single component. Spelled once, in
 * `installCommand` — see there for why it is the `@snapcn/<name>` short form.
 *
 * Both `registry/*` items publish to the same flat `/r/<name>.json`, so the
 * `registry` prop no longer picks a path — it only names the component for the
 * agent prompt.
 *
 * ## Why the prerequisite line is here and not only on the install page
 *
 * A component page is a *landing* page. Every one of them is in the sitemap
 * aimed at a search like "remotion karaoke captions", so the first thing a
 * stranger ever sees of snapcn is this command — and running it in a bare
 * Remotion project fails with `We could not detect a supported framework`,
 * because `shadcn init` does not recognise Remotion and there is no
 * `components.json` for it to read.
 *
 * That is not a hypothesis. It is what happens, it is two steps to avoid, and
 * the page that explains it was reachable only by someone who already knew to
 * look for it. One muted line costs a returning reader nothing and saves a new
 * one the only failure this project reliably produces.
