/**
 * Unit tests for lib/server/entitlements.ts
 *
 * Run with:  pnpm exec vitest run lib/server/__tests__/entitlements.test.ts
 *
 * No database. The one statement that genuinely needs Postgres — the upsert
 * whose `setWhere` decides whether a render is charged — is the one thing a
 * mock cannot honestly simulate, so it is not simulated: the fake returns
 * either a row or nothing, and the tests below cover what this module does with
 * each answer. What IS tested here is every decision made in TypeScript, which
 * is where the money bugs live. A wrong answer from `planFor` hands a churned
 * customer a paid tier forever; a wrong period key gives everyone a second
 * allowance at a month boundary; a missing zero-allowance guard leaks one free
 * render per key per month. None of those need a database to go wrong.
