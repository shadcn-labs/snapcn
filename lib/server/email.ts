 *
 * ## It never throws
 *
 * Every caller is a side effect of something that already succeeded — a row is
 * in the database, an account exists. A mail failure must not turn that into a
 * 500 for the user, so this returns a boolean and logs. Callers wrap it in
 * `after()` so the response does not wait on it either.
 *
 * ## Not configured is a valid state
 *
 * With no `RESEND_API_KEY` the whole thing is a no-op that returns false,
 * matching `isDbConfigured` — `pnpm build` and a fresh clone work with zero
 * setup, and a missing key degrades to "no welcome mail" rather than a crash.

//
// - Tables for the outer frame. Divs centre fine in Gmail and Apple Mail and
//   collapse in Outlook, and Outlook is the one client nobody tests in.
// - Inline styles only. Most clients strip <style> blocks, so a class is a
//   style that works on your machine and nowhere else.
// - Images carry real alt text. Clients block remote images by default, so the
//   logo has to degrade to something readable rather than an empty box — the
//   alt IS the wordmark. Nothing but the logo is an image, so a blocked-image
//   render loses no information at all.
// - A preheader. It is the grey line Gmail prints next to the subject; without
//   one the client grabs the first words of the body, which is why so much mail
//   previews as "View this email in your browser".
// - Colours stated on every element. `prefers-color-scheme` support is uneven
//   and some clients invert unstyled text against a styled background, which is
//   how mail ends up black-on-black.

 *
 * Gmail has no way to be *told* that somebody subscribed. There is no header
 * for it and no API. What it measures is bounces, complaints and engagement,
 * and double opt-in is simply the cheapest way to make all three come out
 * right: a confirmed list is a list of real, reachable people who remember
 * asking.
 *
 * ## What this mail must say
 *
 * That it is the only one, if the reader did not ask for it. Somebody whose

 * nothing follows — which is true, because a row with no `confirmed_at` is
