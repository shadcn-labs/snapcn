 *
 * Ported from the video product's `lib/meter.ts`, monthly-cap limb only. The
 * concurrency limb did NOT come across on purpose: snap-cn's queue is an
 * in-memory Map in `lib/server/render-queue.ts` with its own status vocabulary
 * ("queued" | "rendering" | "done" | "error") and a process-global `p-limit`
