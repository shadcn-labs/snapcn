/**
 * Dodo Payments — checkout creation and webhook verification, over `fetch`.
 *
 * Same reasoning as `lib/server/email.ts`: an SDK here buys a dependency, a
 * bundle, and its own retry opinions inside a function that can be frozen the
 * instant it returns. Two endpoints and an HMAC do not need a package.
 *
 * ## Not configured is a valid state
 *
 * With no `DODO_API_KEY` this whole module is inert and `dodoConfigured()` is
 * false, matching `isDbConfigured` — a fresh clone builds and runs with zero
 * env set, and the paid tier is simply absent rather than a crash. Routes are
 * expected to check first and answer **503** ("billing isn't configured yet"),
 * never 500: a missing key is a deployment state, not a bug in the request.
 *
 * ## Everything here is read at call time
 *
 * Deliberately functions, not module-scope constants. Billing keys are the ones
 * most likely to be rotated or flipped from test to live on a running deploy,
 * and a value captured at import time silently keeps the old mode until the
 * process restarts. Reading `process.env` per call costs nothing next to an
 * HTTPS round trip.
 *
 * ## Field names are load-bearing
 *
 * Dodo **silently ignores unknown JSON fields**. A typo'd key is not a 400 —
 * it is dropped, the call succeeds, and the data is just gone (a mistyped
 * `metadata` means a paid webhook arrives with no user to credit). That is why
 * the request body below is written out literally instead of being spread from
 * a caller-shaped object: every key that goes to Dodo is visible in this file
 * and typo'd once, here, where a test or a review can see it.
 */

/**
 * `api.dodopayments.com` does not exist, and there is no `/v1` prefix — the
