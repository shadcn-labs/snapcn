Install any entry: \`npx shadcn@latest add @snapcn/<name>\`. The source is copied
into the project and the caller owns it — MIT, with no runtime dependency on
snapcn. \`Deps\` installs transitively; do not add those by hand.

Free components with an "Add to Remotion Studio" button can also be added to
one Remotion composition as an editable copy:
\`npx remotion elements use <Docs link> --composition <id>\` (Remotion 4.0.542+).

\`Length\` is how many frames the component's own animation runs at its native
fps. It is the floor for the \`<Sequence>\` that wraps it, not the whole beat:
add hold time on top when the element should stay on screen after it settles.

Full reference for one component — props, examples, the interactive preview —
lives at its Docs link. Every docs URL serves raw markdown: append \`.md\`.
