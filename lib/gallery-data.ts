 * Name and description come from the built registry, which has published them
 * since the tier shipped, so there is no second copy to keep in step.
 *
 * The card links to `/docs/<category>/<slug>`, a page of its own: the video, the
 * description, the price and a FAQ. It used to be `/pro/<slug>`, a redirect to
 * pricing — forty-four components nobody could find by searching for what they
 * do, and a 404 behind every `docs` link the pro registry hands the CLI.
 *
 * Empty when there is no CDN — see `PRO_DEMO_BASE`. A pro card with no video is

 *
 * The spacing is computed, not authored: free length over paid count plus one,
 * so the gap scales as either list grows and no position here goes stale the
 * next time a component ships.
 *
 * A fractional gap, rounded per card — not a whole-number modulo. With 41 free
 * and 14 paid the true gap is 2.73, and flooring it to 2 put all fourteen paid
 * cards inside the first 42 slots and left the last third of the grid without
 * one. The rounding spreads them over the whole list instead.
 *
 * Walked as one merge, each slot going to whichever list is further behind its
 * share, so it still holds once the paid tier outgrows the free one (44 to 41):
 * a slot-per-paid-card scheme had two cards wanting one slot and parked the
 * losers together at the end of the grid.
