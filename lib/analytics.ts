/**
 * The site's typed event vocabulary.
 *
 * Every event below exists to answer a question we would otherwise guess at.
 * If you cannot name the question, do not add the event — a taxonomy nobody
 * reads is worse than no taxonomy, because it looks like coverage.
 *
 *   ┌ Are we converting? ──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 *   │ install_command_copied → registry_component_fetched (server-side, in │
 *   │ middleware.ts). That ratio is the funnel. Copying a string is        │
 *   │ intent; the registry fetch is the install. Everything else on this   │
 *   │ list is a leading indicator of that one line.                        │
 *   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *   • What do people want?      docs_component_viewed, component_code_viewed,
 *                               gallery_filtered, docs_searched (server) —
 *                               zero-result searches are a component request
 *                               in disguise.
 *   • Is the customizer worth   component_customized, customizer_reset,
 *     its complexity?           customized_link_shared. If nobody touches a
 *                               control, its config line can go.
 *   • Does the editor work?     editor_* — export failures are a bug report we
 *                               would otherwise never receive, because the user
 *                               just closes the tab.
 *   • Who will be there on      email_subscribed. The launch list is the largest
 *     launch day?               revenue channel in GTM_PLAN.md §3, and a list is
 *                               only warm if it started collecting months before
 *                               the ask. `source` says which surface earned it.
 *   • Community loop            signed_in.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: scroll depth, rage clicks, generic clicks, time on
 * page, and web vitals — PostHog's autocapture, `$pageleave` and web-vitals
 * config already record all of it. Hand-rolling them would be duplicate data
 * under a second name.
 *
 * Also not here: preview play/pause. Previews autoplay when they scroll into
 * view (`use-lazy-player.ts`), so a "played" event would measure scrolling
 * under a name that reads like intent — worse than not measuring it.
